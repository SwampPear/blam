<h1 class="content__h1">Blam</h1>
<p class="content__p">
    Welcome. Blam is a programming language whose objective is to combine 
    ease-of-use, strong security, and interoperability between existing
    technologies. If you've found yourself here before Blam's been released,
    thanks for checking this project out. The reason I'm writing this
    documentation during the devleopment process for Blam is because I hope it
    can act as a sort of journal where I can document and iron out some of the
    details as I go.

<p class="content__p">
    Blam is intended to be the compromise between a reasonable language anybody
    can write and an efficient and secure language for users with more 
    experience.
