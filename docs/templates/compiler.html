    The details laid out here are mostly for documenting the implementation
    process, but here they are nonetheless.

<h2 class="content__h2">Tokenization</h2>
<p class="content__p">
    The compilation process begins by reading the contents of a source file,
    namely the main.blam file. Once the source contents are read, the tokenizer
    creates a CONTENT node using the entirety of the file. CONTENT nodes are then
    iteratively tokenized according to a rule specified by a certain regular
    expression. Tokenization of source content is complete when either CONTENT
    nodes have been parsed or until all rules have been parsed.

<p class="content__p">
    For example take the following source which will be tokenized with the 
    STRING, OP_EQ, ANUM, and SPACE rules, enumerated by B, C, D, and E 
    respectively (with A enumerating CONTENT):
</p>
<pre class="content__code">
str a = "this is a string"
</pre>
<p class="content__p">
    This will be tokenized in the following steps:
