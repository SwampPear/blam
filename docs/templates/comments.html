<p class="content__p">
    Comments are simply pieces of text that can be ignored during the 
    compilation process. Anything in a comment will not affect the functionality
    of the code. This is what a single line comment looks like:
</p>
<pre class="content__code">
// this is a single line comment
</pre>
<p class="content__p">
    Here is what a multiline comment looks like:
</p>
<pre class="content__code">
/*
* multi line comment
*/
</pre>
<p class="content__p">
    And here is what a docstring comment looks like:
</p>
<pre class="content__code">
/**
* This is a docstring.
*
* @param a - this is a param called a
*/
const someFunc = (str a) -> str {
    return a
}
</pre>
