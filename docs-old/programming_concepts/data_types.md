# Data Types

# Typing

```
// weak typing
a = 0

// strong typing
i8 a = 0
```

# Primitive Data Types

i8  - 8 bit integer
i16 - 16 bit integer
i32 - 32 bit integer
i64 - 32 bit integer

u8  - 8 bit unsigned integer
u16 - 16 bit unsigned integer
u32 - 32 bit unsigned integer
u64 - 64 bit unsigned integer

bool - boolean

char - character

# Arrays

Arrays should always be strongly typed.

```
i16 array[3]
i16 array[] = [1, 2, 3]
```

# Collections

Collections can be weakly typed typed.

let collection = [1, true]

# Vectors

Vectors arrays and vector collections do not have limited size.

```
i16 array<> = <1, 2, 3>
i8 collection = <1, true>
```

# Union and Intersection Types

```
int | str union
int & str intersection
```

# Type Command

type(variable)

# String Type
- one string type globally
